						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>I have a degree in Zoology and experience as an Ecologist both in the U.K. and Australia. I am also a qualified bicycle mechanic, fire warden, first aider, 4wd driver, experienced rock climber and cyclist and a keen naturalist, currently with a particular interest in Fungi.</p>
						
						<p>Having come through Mayden Academy at the ripe old age of 30 I feel I can bring to bear half a life time of experiences and the passion of someone who has found their calling in life.</p>
						
						<p>Through Mayden I have recieved experience with all the software you would expect of a full stack developer with a particiular focus on PHP and .JS. I am a qualified scrum master with multiple agile projects under my belt and I am always looking for my next challenge so get in touch if you have one for me.</p>
